    <h2>My Unforgettable Hiking Story</h2>

    <p><strong>Orientation:</strong><br>
    Last holiday, I went on an amazing adventure hiking Mount Salak with my close friends. We carefully prepared our equipment—raincoats, food, flashlights, and camping gear. The morning sky was cloudy, yet the cool wind made our steps lighter. Our goal was to reach the summit and feel the beauty of nature together.</p>

    <p><strong>Events:</strong><br>
    We began our hike from the Pasir Reungit trail. The first path was surrounded by tall trees and the sound of chirping birds. As we climbed higher, the trail became steeper and more challenging. At one point, we reached the famous <em>Tanjakan Wayahna</em>, where ropes were needed to climb up. It was tough but exciting! After several hours of hiking, we finally reached <strong>Puncak Prabu</strong> at 2,180 meters above sea level. The view was breathtaking—the fog rolled over green hills and we could even see distant city lights. We took photos, shared snacks, and celebrated our success. That night, we met a friendly dog at camp who stayed with us, making the experience even more memorable.</p>

    <p><strong>Reorientation:</strong><br>
    The hike to Mount Salak taught me the meaning of teamwork, patience, and respect for nature. Even though it was exhausting, I came home proud and grateful. It reminded me that every hard journey leads to something beautiful.</p>
